# oss-repo-template
> ðŸ“„ a template for axodotdev's open source repositories

This is a template repo for @axodotdev's open source projects.

## Quickstart

The README should contain a brief set of steps on how to go from installation to
"Hello World". It should also link to more in depth and comprehensive install
and usage documentation.

For a package, this should indicate how to add the package (e.g. cut and paste
into `Cargo.toml`) and then a short example.

For a cli, this should explain the preferred installation method and then offer
the most common set of commands (e.g. `axo init && axo run`).

The code block for the example or command set shouldn't exceed 20 lines, but
exceptions can be made.
